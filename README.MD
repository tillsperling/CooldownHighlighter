# Cooldown Highlighter

A small World of Warcraft Addon that translates the spell highlight from the action bars to the new Cooldown Manager.

- Works with spells and simple /cast or /use macros
- For now only works with the default action bars, i havent implemented a mapping to ElvUi, Dominos or Bartender
- It is possible to detect trinket or item usage but i will implement that in the future if Blizzard decides to implement items into the CDM
- Can be used with the default CDM or the popular CDM skinning addons like Cooldown Manager Centered, NephUI: Cooldown Manager or BetterCooldownManager.
- ArcUI not supported
