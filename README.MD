# Cooldown Highlighter

A small World of Warcraft Addon that translates the spell highlight from the action bars to the new Cooldown Manager.

- Works with Spells and Macros, potentially Items when they're trackable by the manager.
- Can be used with the popular CDM Manager Skinning Addons like NephCDM, BetterCDM or CDMCentered.
