# Cooldown Highlighter

A small World of Warcraft Addon that translates the spell highlight from the action bars to the new Cooldown Manager.

- Works with spells and simple /cast macros
- It is possible to detect trinket or item usage but i will implement that in the future if Blizzard decides to implement items into the CDM
- Can be used with the popular CDM Manager Skinning Addons like NephCDM, BetterCDM or CDMCentered.
